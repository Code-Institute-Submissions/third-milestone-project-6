## Introduction
<br>

[AR Agency](https://ar-recriutment-agency.herokuapp.com/) was created by both Ayo Akinsola and Ruth Dara-Akinsola to help organizations grow by finding the right talents. 
Talents that really match the corporate culture. We believe that this is the basis for a long-term relationship. 
If talents believe in what you believe, it is possible to build a strong brand and achieve structural growth.
