## Design Choices

The AR Agency has an overall professional feel, with emphasis on appealing to both visitors and business users. The following design choices were made with this in mind:

### Fonts

- The primary font `Poppins` was chosen because geometric shape of the letter form is near equal in terms of height and the spacing between characters is perfect. It looks great as a heading font and as body text.

- The secondary font `Raleway` was chosen the appearance is sharp and functional. Raleway brings an elegant, yet bold presence to any website.

### Icons

- Social media icons for facebook, instagram and twitter are used only in the footer on the site. 

### Template Style

I opted for the [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com// "Bootstrap Official Site") framework. 
As a tool, Bootstrap 4 is excellent to get started,it offers improved grid system with a new tier that allows you to target mobile users better than ever before. Additionally, semantic mixins have undergone the major update as well.


## Wireframes

The wireframe was created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) during the conceptul phase and project proposal to my mentor. 

You can find the wireframe [here](https://1drv.ms/b/s!AqARRU4jO5elunG2T1AiA9FteWuU?e=YpZqiG).

## PDF
- [AR Agency Database Schema]()

This document was created during the planning phase of this project. The final website has some slight differences from what was planned. 
But I included this document in the project to provide insight into the original planning and direction of the site during the planning stages.
